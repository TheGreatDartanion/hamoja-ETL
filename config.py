Here is my MySQL DB information.

You can open MySQL workbench and login with the host name below.

Feel free to use my user name and password (see below)

Once you are connected, open the travel_auth database 
(USE travel_auth;)

Then query the client_info table 
(SELECT * FROM travel_info)

This should be enough to get you started.

Good luck!
